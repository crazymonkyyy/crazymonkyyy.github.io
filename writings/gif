</span></h1><h2><span style="color:#fdf6e3">A brief history of computers user interfaces

</span></h2><span style="background-color:#002b36"><span style="color:#fdf6e3">Back when dinosaurs roamed the earth, and reality was in black a white, there was a room-sized computer and someone was deciding how to talk to it.

They had electronic telegram machines, where you'd type </span></span><span class="code"><span style="color:#fdf6e3">"sos"</span></span><span style="background-color:#002b36"><span style="color:#fdf6e3"> on a qwerty keyboard and down some wire a signal of </span></span><span class="code"><span style="color:#fdf6e3">---...---</span></span><span style="background-color:#002b36"><span style="color:#fdf6e3"> would be sent, and the other end a machine would read that signal and decode it as </span></span><span class="code"><span style="color:#fdf6e3">"sos"</span></span><span style="background-color:#002b36"><span style="color:#fdf6e3"> and print it out on some paper.

They took a telegram machine and set it up so you talk to this room-sized computer via telegram.

And then nothing.

NOTHING!

Computers still are running as if they were being talked to via telegram, and everyone is maintaining a pile of shit to hide the shame that no one has made a new (successful) os in decades.

That is what a terminal is, you talking to a computer via telegram; do not treat it like magic.

This one line is 90% of the difficulty of how this project was made and I will be breaking it down slowly 

</span></span><h2><span style="color:#dc322f">#!

</span></h2><span style="background-color:#002b36"><span style="color:#fdf6e3">This character combo, at the start of a file, tells a Linux system that this is a script.

And a script, using this very important bit of computer history, is when a computer pretends it sends itself a telegram. Character to character, as if a human wrote it.

It is followed by which "shell" or "telegram listener" it should send the file to.

Putting it all together, you do that hardest part of all programming, getting a computer to just even remotely consider listening to you.

Voronoi diagrams and growing circles

<img src="/images/layer1.gif" alt="circles growing into a voronoi diagram">

</span></h2><span style="background-color:#002b36"><span style="color:#fdf6e3">It's a well-known result that growing circles will produce a Voronoi diagram, I'm very much not breaking ground here.

To render a Voronoi diagram (in a terrible way) each pixel asks "What color is my nearest point"

To render a circle (in a terrible way), each pixel asks "How far away from the center am I" and compares it to the radius

To render a "ring" it's the same as the circle but there's a minimum radius

<img src="/images/diagram.gif" alt="nonsense diagram I thought may make things clearer idk">

This all quite naturally combines, where I precomputed the color and distance for each pixel, and in each frame, the precomputed result is compared to a global min and max distances. All I needed to do was keep the min distance quite small for a long time, and well the end seemed boring I added some complexity.

</span></span><h2><span style="color:#fdf6e3">Random circles alone are interesting

<img src="/images/layer2.gif" alt="random circles spawning in">

</span></h2><span style="background-color:#002b36"><span style="color:#fdf6e3">Using the same logic a precomputed layer of data of a distance and indexed color, circles that pop in and out are enough to make something worth looking at.

Instead of a random color tho, I grabbed the color from the layer 1 Voronoi diagram to keep it consistent.

</span></span><h2><span style="color:#fdf6e3">Animation is simple math, with terrible tooling

</span></h2><span style="background-color:#002b36"><span style="color:#fdf6e3">With those tools in hand, the question becomes, what to set these 4 values?

#!animation_math.d

It was awful trial and error and it's this awful bit of code; so here's a helpful graph. I would like to see these sorts of things be easy to draw, I don't understand why the tool doesn't exist where you draw some lines, and you get some math out, or hell a list of values.

</span></h2><span style="background-color:#002b36"><span style="color:#fdf6e3">After that was all said and done, it was still a little lifeless, and 2 megabytes, more than I want to trust will download instantly.

So gifs are a list of pictures and you can just change the timings, so I found the website <a href="https://ezgif.com/">https://ezgif.com/</a> and started deleting frames and made some key frames longer, such as the first one; giving your computer time to get a head start to download the image and getting it down to 357.8 kb
