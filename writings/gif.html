</span></h2><span style="background-color:#002b36"><span style="color:#fdf6e3">Back when dinosaurs roamed the earth, and reality was in black a white, there was a room-sized computer and someone was deciding how to talk to it.
<p>
They had electronic telegram machines, where you'd type </span></span><span class="code"><span style="color:#fdf6e3">"sos"</span></span><span style="background-color:#002b36"><span style="color:#fdf6e3"> on a qwerty keyboard and down some wire a signal of </span></span><span class="code"><span style="color:#fdf6e3">---...---</span></span><span style="background-color:#002b36"><span style="color:#fdf6e3"> would be sent, and the other end a machine would read that signal and decode it as </span></span><span class="code"><span style="color:#fdf6e3">"sos"</span></span><span style="background-color:#002b36"><span style="color:#fdf6e3"> and print it out on some paper.
<p>
They took a telegram machine and set it up so you talk to this room-sized computer via telegram.
<p>
And then nothing.
<p>
NOTHING!
<p>
Computers still are running as if they were being talked to via telegram, and everyone is maintaining a pile of shit to hide the shame that no one has made a new (successful) os in decades.
