Flexible, self-taught programmer, who works on Linux in Dlang. Strong believer in the KISS principal and that good code comes from refusing erroneous requirements, prototyping early and designing for data.

I'm open to interesting work, pereferably with D, but I would also accept random job offers in C, C++, Zig, and other sane C-like languges.
